CAS Overlay Template
============================

Generic CAS WAR overlay to exercise the latest versions of CAS. This overlay could be freely used as a starting template for local CAS war overlays. The CAS services management overlay is available [here](https://github.com/apereo/cas-services-management-overlay).

# Versions

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.x</cas.version>
```

# Requirements

* JDK 1.8+

# Configuration

The `etc` directory contains the configuration files and directories that need to be copied to `/etc/cas/config`.

# Build

To see what commands are available to the build script, run:

```bash
./build.sh help
```

To package the final web application, run:

```bash
./build.sh package
```

# Deployment

- Create a keystore file `thekeystore` under `/etc/cas`. Use the password `changeit` for both the keystore and the key/certificate entries.
- Ensure the keystore is loaded up with keys and certificates of the server.

On a successful deployment via the following methods, CAS will be available at:

* `http://cas.server.name:8080/cas`
* `https://cas.server.name:8443/cas`


## Spring Boot App Server Selection

There is an app.server property in the `pom.xml` that can be used to select a spring boot application server.
It defaults to `-tomcat` but `-jetty` and `-undertow` are supported.

It can also be set to an empty value (nothing) if you want to deploy CAS to an external application server of your choice.

```xml
<app.server>-tomcat<app.server>
```

## Windows Build

If you are building on windows, try `build.cmd` instead of `build.sh`. Arguments are similar but for usage, run:

```
build.cmd help
```

## External

Deploy resultant `target/cas.war`  to a servlet container of choice.


## Command Line Shell

Invokes the CAS Command Line Shell. For a list of commands either use no arguments or use `-h`. To enter the interactive shell use `-sh`.

```bash
./build.sh cli
```

## application.properties
This has a MYSQL point, which requires a username/password to be setup.

## TODO
Complete final section of documentation on how to implement this
